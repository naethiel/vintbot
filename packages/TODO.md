# TODO squirreled project

- ~Redo the API layer with express because simplicity/ubiquity~ Fstify is fine. Just refactor it so it looks like real api code
- Redo the front end layer with next/app instead of next/pages and try RSC :p 
- Change the model to better match the needs of a UI driven app
- Add CRUD operations to UI.
